    <h1>The History of HTML</h1>
    <p class="dent info">"For its first five years (1990-1995), HTML went through a number of revisions and experienced a number of extensions, primarily hosted first at CERN, and then at the IETF.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info"> With the creation of the W3C, HTML's development changed venue again. A first abortive attempt at extending HTML in 1995 known as HTML 3.0 then made way to a more pragmatic approach known as HTML 3.2, which was completed in 1997. HTML4 followed, reaching completion in 1998.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info"> At this time, the W3C membership decided to stop evolving HTML and instead begin work on an XML-based equivalent, called XHTML. This effort started with a reformulation of HTML4 in XML, known as XHTML 1.0, which added no new features except the new serialization, and which was completed in 2000. After XHTML 1.0, the W3C's focus turned to making it easier for other working groups to extend XHTML, under the banner of XHTML Modularization. In parallel with this, the W3C also worked on a new language that was not compatible with the earlier HTML and XHTML languages, calling it XHTML2.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">Around the time that HTML's evolution was stopped in 1998, parts of the API for HTML developed by browser vendors were specified and published under the name DOM Level 1 (in 1998) and DOM Level 2 Core and DOM Level 2 HTML (starting in 2000 and culminating in 2003). These efforts then petered out, with some DOM Level 3 specifications published in 2004 but the working group being closed before all the Level 3 drafts were completed.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">In 2003, the publication of XForms, a technology which was positioned as the next generation of Web forms, sparked a renewed interest in evolving HTML itself, rather than finding replacements for it. This interest was borne from the realization that XML's deployment as a Web technology was limited to entirely new technologies (like RSS and later Atom), rather than as a replacement for existing deployed technologies (like HTML).</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">A proof of concept to show that it was possible to extend HTML4's forms to provide many of the features that XForms 1.0 introduced, without requiring browsers to implement rendering engines that were incompatible with existing HTML Web pages, was the first result of this renewed interest. At this early stage, while the draft was already publicly available, and input was already being solicited from all sources, the specification was only under Opera Software's copyright.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">The idea that HTML's evolution should be reopened was tested at a W3C workshop in 2004, where some of the principles that underlie the HTML5 work (described below), as well as the aforementioned early draft proposal covering just forms-related features, were presented to the W3C jointly by Mozilla and Opera. The proposal was rejected on the grounds that the proposal conflicted with the previously chosen direction for the Web's evolution; the W3C staff and membership voted to continue developing XML-based replacements instead.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">Shortly thereafter, Apple, Mozilla, and Opera jointly announced their intent to continue working on the effort under the umbrella of a new venue called the WHATWG. A public mailing list was created, and the draft was moved to the WHATWG site. The copyright was subsequently amended to be jointly owned by all three vendors, and to allow reuse of the specification.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">The WHATWG was based on several core principles, in particular that technologies need to be backwards compatible, that specifications and implementations need to match even if this means changing the specification rather than the implementations, and that specifications need to be detailed enough that implementations can achieve complete interoperability without reverse-engineering each other.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">The latter requirement in particular required that the scope of the HTML5 specification include what had previously been specified in three separate documents: HTML4, XHTML1, and DOM2 HTML. It also meant including significantly more detail than had previously been considered the norm.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">In 2006, the W3C indicated an interest to participate in the development of HTML5 after all, and in 2007 formed a working group chartered to work with the WHATWG on the development of the HTML5 specification. Apple, Mozilla, and Opera allowed the W3C to publish the specification under the W3C copyright, while keeping a version with the less restrictive license on the WHATWG site.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">Since then, both groups have been working together.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">The HTML specification published by the WHATWG is not identical to this specification. At the time of this publication, the main differences were that the WHATWG version included features not included in this W3C version: some features have been omitted, but may be considered for future revisions of HTML beyond HTML5; and other features were omitted because at the W3C they are published as separate specifications.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">A separate document has been published by the W3C HTML working group to document the differences between this specification and the language described in the HTML4 specification.</p>

<h1>The History of CSS</h1>
<p class="dent info">"Like HTML, CSS is standardized by the W3 consortium. CSS is an open, independent and freely usable standard. As with HTML, a working group exists for CSS who concerns itself with development of the standard. This is being done in accordance with W3C rules.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">CSS comes in different versions. CSS level 1 was released in 1996, and republished with corections in 1999. CSS level 2 appeared in 1998 and built on CSS level 1. CSS level 2 adds support for different output media. CSS 3 is currently in development and will be split up in modules.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">The idea behind it was to seperate presentation and content of a web site. The advantage of this approach is that updates and changes to the presentation need only be applied once (to the stylesheet) to affect all pages. Especially large sites can achieve significant time savings. In order to enforce this separation of concerns, the W3C has deprecated the &lt;font&gt; tag in HTML 4. Newer (X)HTML versions will deprecate other tags in a similar vein.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">CSS stylesheets are an immediate addition to HTML. CSS is a language to define format properties of HTML or XML tags. HTML has reached the end of it's shelf life and is not being developed further. XHTML is the new standard instead. XHTML reformulates HTML with XML syntax while at the same time getting rid of presentational markup. XHTML only contains content, presentation is the domain of a CSS stylesheet. This allows for different stylesheets for different output formats such as print, aural or small devices. Search machines on the other hand have an easier job if they are only presented with content markup."</p>

<h1>The History of JavaScript</h1>
<p class="dent info">JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications. It was inspired by Java, Scheme and Self.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">Netscape, for a time, made the best browser in the world and enjoyed market dominance.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">In late 1995, when Microsoft cottoned-on to the competitive threat the Web posed, the Internet Explorer project was started in an all-out attempt to wrestle control of the emerging platform from Netscape.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">In so doing Microsoft became a mortal threat, compelling Netscape to respond. First, they started a standardization process to prevent Microsoft gaining control of the JavaScript language. Second, they partnered with Sun to leverage their shared interest in breaking the Microsoft monopoly.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">Sun began development of Java in 1990 in an attempt to write a language for “smart appliances”. This approach floundered and in 1994, Sun regrouped and set sights on the Web as the delivery platform of choice.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">So the Netscape/Sun partnership meant Sun acquired the use of a competitive browser and a delivery system for their strategic technology.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">Netscape, on the other hand found a powerful ally against Microsoft. They also aimed to out-manoeuvre Microsoft by being the official browser of the highly anticipated platform that was Java.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">Brendan Eich has said that with Sun on board, they decided to surf the tidal wave of hype surrounding Java and position JavaScript as the companion language to Java, in the same way Visual Basic was to C++. So the name was a straightforward marketing ploy to gain acceptance.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">Netscape’s Mocha (later JavaScript) aimed to turn the web into a full-blown application platform. Furthermore, when used together with their LiveWire application server product, it would enable isomorphic development, with the same language used on both client and server.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">If this sounds familiar, it is because this was exactly what Sun was attempting to pull off with Java. At the time however, the Web was very limited when compared to Java; for example, drawing pixels was not possible in JavaScript as it is now with canvas. So Sun (erroneously, I believe) never saw the language as a competitor and the alliance held.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">Unfortunately for JavaScript, its early market positioning outlived its usefulness and later became a brake on market acceptance as it emerged as a viable technology in its own right.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">So JavaScript was conceived as a scripting language for the Web for both client and server side. It was then quickly re-positioned as a Web “companion” for Java.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">The unique circumstances of the birth of the language, including:</p>
<br>
<ul class="info">
  <li>the aforementioned marketing ploy,</li>
  <li>time-compressed initial development,</li>
  <li>a prejudice that development for the Web was not “serious”,</li>
  <li>the ubiquitous and “unbreakable” deployment environment (the Web), and</li>
  <li>the inclusion of language design elements unfamiliar to most developers</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p class="dent info">…led to a years-long period of misunderstanding, scorn and, yes, even hatred for the language. In the late 1990s and early 2000s even the authors of some books on JavaScript didn’t understand the fundamental elements of the language.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">Douglas Crockford was one of the pioneers of the rediscovery of the language. And the importance of his invention of the JSON data format using a subset of JavaScript syntax should not be underestimated. During the 2000s mindshare slowly shifted to view JavaScript as a serious language: a critical mass of developers emerged who understood the language.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">However, the “outsider status” of JavaScript continues to reverberate. Early design choices like automatic semicolon insertion (ASI), the event loop, lack of classes, unusual inheritance (prototypical) and type coercion are laughed at by people who have not taken the time to understand the thinking behind them.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">Developers watch other developers laughing at these features and infer that these features are worthy of ridicule and the cycle continues.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">Even Brendan Eich, the creator of the language, is occasionally apologetic for design decisions he made for the language.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">However, in my view these expressions of apology should not be taken as confirmation that those decisions were wrong: but rather acknowledgement of the necessary inability of one language to please all developers.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">As we will see in later posts, criticisms of JavaScript are frequently insubstantial expressions of unfamiliarity or syntactic “taste”, by programmers more familiar with other languages.</p>
<br>
<p class="dent info">This is not to say the language is without flaws: the continuing lack of a decimal number primitive is unfortunate.</p>
